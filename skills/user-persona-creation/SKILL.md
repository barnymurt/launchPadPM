# User Persona Creation

Create structured, behavior-driven user personas for SaaS and digital products. Unlike raw LLM output that produces generic, demographic-heavy personas ("Sarah, 34, marketing manager, likes coffee"), this skill produces personas grounded in real behavioral patterns — organized around jobs-to-be-done, pain points, decision criteria, and SaaS-specific attributes like adoption triggers, churn signals, and willingness to pay. The result is a persona a product team can actually design and prioritize against.

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context and Research Inputs

Establish what information exists before creating personas:

1. **Identify available evidence:**
   - User interviews or survey data (strongest signal)
   - Support tickets or feature requests (behavioral evidence)
   - Analytics data (usage patterns, funnel drop-offs)
   - Sales call notes or CRM data (buying patterns)
   - Founder/team intuition (weakest signal — label as assumption)

2. **Assess the product stage:**
   - Pre-launch (no users) → Persona is hypothesis-driven. Label everything Low confidence. Focus on the problem space, not product features.
   - Early-stage (some users) → Blend evidence with assumptions. Identify which persona attributes are validated vs. hypothesized.
   - Growth-stage (meaningful data) → Evidence-driven. Prioritize behavioral data over demographics.

3. **Clarify scope:** Ask the user:
   - What does the product do and for whom?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - How many distinct user types do they believe exist?
   - Do they have any user research, analytics, or customer feedback available?

If the user provides only a product idea with no research, proceed with hypothesis-driven personas but flag every assumption explicitly. Do not invent research that doesn't exist.

### Step 2: Identify Behavioral Segments

Segment users by behavior and need, not demographics:

1. **Map the jobs-to-be-done:**
   - What functional job does the user hire this product to do? (e.g., "Track project progress across my team")
   - What emotional job? (e.g., "Feel confident my team is on track")
   - What social job? (e.g., "Look organized to my clients")

2. **Identify distinct behavioral clusters:**
   - Group users by HOW they use the product (frequency, features used, workflow)
   - Group by WHY they use it (different jobs, different trigger events)
   - Group by WHERE they are in the adoption lifecycle (evaluators, new users, power users, at-risk users)

3. **Apply segmentation criteria from [references/framework.md](references/framework.md):**
   - Primary segmentation: Job-to-be-done (what they need to accomplish)
   - Secondary segmentation: Adoption stage (how they relate to the product)
   - Tertiary segmentation: Decision-making pattern (how they evaluate and buy)

Target: 2-4 personas for most SaaS products. More than 5 signals over-segmentation — merge or prioritize. Fewer than 2 suggests insufficient understanding of the user landscape.

### Step 3: Build Each Persona Profile

For each identified segment, construct a full persona following the schema in [references/output-schema.md](references/output-schema.md):

1. **Identity (brief):** Name, role, and one-sentence behavioral summary. Demographics only where they influence product decisions (e.g., technical proficiency affects onboarding design).

2. **Jobs-to-be-done:** Primary functional job, emotional job, social job. State the context (when, where, how often) and the desired outcome.

3. **Current workflow:** How they accomplish the job today (before using this product). Identify each step, what tools they use, and where the friction is. This is where product opportunities live.

4. **Pain points:** Specific, observable frustrations — not generic complaints. Each pain must be tied to a workflow step or a job-to-be-done. Rate severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low).

5. **Gains sought:** What "better" looks like for them. What would make them recommend the product? What metrics improve in their life/work?

6. **Decision criteria:** How they evaluate and choose tools. What matters most? (Price, ease of use, integrations, brand trust, peer recommendation, specific feature). Rank the top 3-5 criteria.

7. **SaaS-specific attributes:** Apply the SaaS lens from [references/framework.md](references/framework.md):
   - Adoption trigger: What event causes them to search for a solution?
   - Evaluation behavior: How do they evaluate? (Free trial, demo request, peer review, comparison site)
   - Willingness to pay: What's their budget range? Who approves the purchase?
   - Churn signals: What would cause them to leave?
   - Expansion triggers: What would cause them to upgrade or add seats?

8. **Technology adoption profile:** Where do they sit on the adoption lifecycle? (Innovator, Early Adopter, Early Majority, Late Majority, Laggard). This affects messaging, onboarding, and feature expectations.

### Step 4: Map Persona Relationships

Show how personas relate to each other and to the product:

1. **Persona priority matrix:** Rank personas by strategic importance:
   - Revenue potential (willingness to pay x segment size)
   - Acquisition feasibility (how reachable, how ready to buy)
   - Retention potential (likelihood to stay and expand)
   - Product alignment (how well the current/planned product serves them)

2. **Interaction mapping:** How do the personas interact?
   - Does one persona buy and another use? (Buyer vs. User)
   - Does one persona influence another's adoption? (Champion vs. Decision-maker)
   - Do personas collaborate within the product? (Different roles, same workflow)

3. **Conflict identification:** Where do persona needs conflict?
   - Feature A benefits Persona 1 but complicates things for Persona 2
   - Pricing that works for Persona 1's segment is too expensive for Persona 2

### Step 5: Validate and Assign Confidence

Review each persona for quality and tag confidence levels:

1. **Evidence audit:** For each persona attribute, tag the source:
   - **High confidence [H]:** Based on user research, analytics, or direct customer data
   - **Medium confidence [M]:** Based on industry patterns, analogous products, or limited data
   - **Low confidence [L]:** Based on assumption or founder intuition — needs validation

2. **Completeness check:** Verify every required field in the schema is populated. Flag any persona where >50% of attributes are Low confidence — this persona is a hypothesis, not a finding.

3. **Differentiation check:** Each persona must be meaningfully different from the others. If two personas share the same job-to-be-done, same pain points, and same decision criteria, merge them.

### Step 6: Generate Validation Recommendations

Personas are living documents — provide a plan to validate and update them:

1. **Highest-risk assumptions:** List the 3-5 assumptions with the biggest impact if wrong
2. **Validation methods:** For each assumption, suggest how to validate (user interviews, A/B tests, analytics, surveys)
3. **Update triggers:** Define when the personas should be revisited (new market entered, significant churn spike, major feature launch, quarterly review)

## Output Format

The output follows the structure defined in [references/output-schema.md](references/output-schema.md):

- **Context** — product description, research inputs, methodology notes
- **Persona Profiles** (2-4) — full structured profile for each persona
- **Persona Priority Matrix** — ranked by strategic importance with scores
- **Relationship Map** — how personas interact and where they conflict
- **Confidence Summary** — overall evidence quality and key assumptions
- **Validation Plan** — highest-risk assumptions and how to test them

Expected length: 2,000-4,000 words depending on the number of personas.

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Pain points are specific and tied to workflow steps (not generic frustrations)
- [ ] Decision criteria are ranked, not just listed
- [ ] SaaS-specific attributes included (adoption trigger, churn signals, willingness to pay)
- [ ] Technology adoption lifecycle position assigned to each persona

## Common Mistakes

1. **Demographics-first personas:** Leading with age, gender, education, and hobbies instead of behavior and motivation. Demographics are only useful when they directly influence product decisions (e.g., technical proficiency affects onboarding complexity). A persona built around "34-year-old marketing manager who enjoys hiking" tells the product team nothing actionable.

2. **Aspirational instead of evidence-based:** Creating personas that describe ideal users rather than real ones. If the product is pre-launch with no users, label the personas as hypotheses. Don't write them with the same confidence as research-backed personas — this creates false certainty that leads to building the wrong thing.

3. **Pain points without context:** Listing generic frustrations ("too many tools," "wastes time") without connecting them to specific workflow steps or JTBD. Every pain point must answer: pain doing WHAT, during WHICH step, and HOW SEVERE? "Wastes time" is useless. "Spends 45 minutes every Monday manually compiling status updates from 3 different tools" is actionable.

4. **Missing the buyer-user distinction:** In B2B SaaS, the person who buys the product is often not the person who uses it daily. A persona set that only describes end-users misses the decision-maker whose criteria (ROI, compliance, vendor reputation) drive the purchase. Always check: who pays, who decides, and who uses?

5. **Too many personas:** Creating 6+ personas to cover every possible user type. This dilutes focus and makes prioritization impossible. If the product team can't name their top 2 personas and explain how they differ, there are too many. Merge similar personas and deprioritize edge cases.
